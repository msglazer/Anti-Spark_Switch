# Anti Spark Switch
Personal improvements/changes to the vedder antispark switch

Design allows for a battery to be connected to a source without the usual spark in the connector, also provides a convenient on off ability.
Improvements to the design include an upgraded, more robust fuse and fuse holder, an additional MOSFET for higher current handling as well as
better distribution of power through the MOSFETs. There is also the option of adding an LED powered through the PCB, the LED is powered after the MOSFET switch

There are two versions currently, with fuse and without fuse. The without fuse version is located in its own branch, master contains the fuse version
